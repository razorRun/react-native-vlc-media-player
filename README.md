# react-native-vlc-media-player

### New feature requests and bug fixes

At the moment I am a bit tied up with other work. As a matter of fact, I don't get much time to develop at all nowadays. But I am more than open to help anyone who wants's to contribute to this repo. And I will be sure to merge any fixes as soon as PR's come up. But if you need someone to fix issues that affect you till I get back to this(ETA Q3 2022), One option is to add a bounty to the following site https://www.bountysource.com/ someone will attend to it.

## Supported RN Versions

- 0.59 > 0.62 and up
- PODs are updated to work with 0.61 and up (tested in 0.61.5, 0.62 and 0.63)

## Supported formats

Support for network streams, RTSP, RTP, RTMP, HLS, MMS.
Play all files, [in all formats, including exotic ones, like the classic VLC media player.](#-More-formats)
Play MKV, multiple audio tracks (including 5.1), and subtitles tracks (including SSA!)

## Sample repo

[VLC Media Player test](https://github.com/razorRun/react-native-vlc-media-player-test)

## Add it to your project

Run

`npm i react-native-vlc-media-player --save`

or

`yarn add react-native-vlc-media-player`

If not using Expo also run

`react-native link react-native-vlc-media-player`

## Android

Should work without any specific settings. Gradle build might fail with `More than one file was found with OS independent path 'lib/x86/libc++_shared.so'` error.

If that happens, add the following block to your `android/app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
tasks.whenTaskAdded((tas -> {
    // when task is 'mergeLocalDebugNativeLibs' or 'mergeLocalReleaseNativeLibs'
    if (tas.name.contains("merge") && tas.name.contains("NativeLibs")) {
        tasks.named(tas.name) {it
            doFirst {
                java.nio.file.Path notNeededDirectory = it.externalLibNativeLibs
                        .getFiles()
                        .stream()
                        // for React Native 0.71, the file value now contains "jetified-react-android" instead of "jetified-react-native"
                        .filter(file -> file.toString().contains("jetified-react-native"))
                        .findAny()
                        .orElse(null)
                        .toPath();
                java.nio.file.Files.walk(notNeededDirectory).forEach(file -> {
                    if (file.toString().contains("libc++_shared.so")) {
                        java.nio.file.Files.delete(file);
                    }
                });
            }
        }
    }
}))
```

### Explanation
`react-native` and `LibVLC` both import `libc++_shared.so`, but we cannot use `packagingOptions.pickFirst` to handle this case, because `libvlc-all:3.6.0-eap5` will crash when using `libc++_shared.so`, so we have to use `libc++_shared.so` from `LibVLC`.

Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74258902/how-to-define-which-so-file-to-use-in-gradle-packaging-options

### Also to consider
`libvlc-all:3.2.6` has a bug where subtitles won't display on Android 12 and 13, so we have to upgrade `LibVLC` to support it.

Reference: https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc-android/-/issues/2252

## iOS

1. cd to ios
2. run `pod init` (if only Podfile has not been generated in ios folder)
3. add `pod 'MobileVLCKit', '3.3.10'` to pod file **(No need if you are running RN 0.61 and up)**
4. run `pod install` (you have to delete the app on the simulator/device and run `react-native run-ios` again)

### Important

Starting from iOS 14, you are required to provide a message for the `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` key in `Info.plist` if your app uses the local network directly or indirectly.

It seems the `MobileVLCKit` library powering the VLC Player on iOS makes use of this feature when playing external media from sources such as RTSP streams from IP cameras.

Provide a custom message specifying how your app will make use of the network so your App Store submission is not rejected for this reason, read more about this here:

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/nslocalnetworkusagedescription

### Optional

In root project select "Build Settings", find "Bitcode" and select "Enable Bitcode"

## Expo

This package works with Expo, Expo Go does not include custom native code so you must use a [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/).

To enable just insert the `react-native-vlc-media-player` plugin to the "plugins" array from `app.config.js` or `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-video",
        {
          "ios": {
              "includeVLCKit": false
          },
          "android": {
              "legacyJetifier": false
          }
        }
      ]
    ],
  }
}
```

### Configuring the plugin is optional:

- Set `ios.includeVLCKit` to `true` if using RN < 0.61
- Set `android.legacyJetifier` to `true` if using RN < 0.71

Then rebuild your app as described in the ["Adding custom native code"](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/customizing/) guide.

## Usage

```jsx
import { VLCPlayer, VlCPlayerView } from 'react-native-vlc-media-player';
import Orientation from 'react-native-orientation';

<VLCPlayer
  style={[styles.video]}
  videoAspectRatio="16:9"
  source={{ uri: "https://www.radiantmediaplayer.com/media/big-buck-bunny-360p.mp4" }}
/>

// Or you can use

<VlCPlayerView
  autoplay={false}
  url="https://www.radiantmediaplayer.com/media/big-buck-bunny-360p.mp4"
  Orientation={Orientation}
  ggUrl=""
  showGG={true}
  showTitle={true}
  title="Big Buck Bunny"
  showBack={true}
  onLeftPress={()=>{}}
/>
```

## Got a few minutes to spare? Please help us to keep this repo up to date and simple to use.

#### Our idea was to keep the repo simple, and people can use it with newer RN versions without any additional config.

1. Get a fork of this repo and clone [VLC Media Player test](https://github.com/razorRun/react-native-vlc-media-player-test)
2. Run it for ios and android locally using your fork, and do the changes. (remove this package using `npm remove react-native-vlc-media-player` and install the forked version from git hub `npm i https://git-address-to-your-forked-repo`)
3. Verify your changes and make sure everything works on both platforms. (If you need a hand with testing I might be able to help as well)
4. Send PR.
5. Be happy, Cause you're a Rockstar 🌟 ❤️

## TODO

1. Android video aspect ratio and other params do not work (Events are called but all events come through a single event onVideoStateChange but the JS side does not implement it)
